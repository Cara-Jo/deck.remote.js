To run deck.remote.js you must include deck.remote.js to your deck.js slides. No stylesheets or html is required.

Before starting the presentation run the node.js daemon located in deck-remote-server/main.js. Make sure you init and update submodules (currently it's using WebSocket-Node.git by Worlize).

Once the daemon is running, open your presentation and the client (deck-remote-client/index.html) in your browser. Changes made on the client should reflect on the server, and the other way around.

At the moment it has only been tested with Firefox.
